# How to add a News message

1. Go to the folder: `src/content/news/`
2. Copy the template `src/content/templates/news.md` into the `src/content/news/` folder and rename the copied template file with format `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md` (date is optional, but recommended for sorting).
3. Fill in the copied template file in Markdown format. See the template for required fields.
4. Build and preview the website locally using hot reloading: `npm run dev`.
5. Does the new news message look good? Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch. The website will automatically update.
