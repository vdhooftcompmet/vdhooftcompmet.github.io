1. Go to the folder: `src/content/people/`
2. Copy the template `src/content/templates/person.md` into the `src/content/people/` folder and rename the copied template file with format `firstname-lastname.md`.
3. Fill in the copied template file in Markdown format. See the template for required fields.
4. Build and preview the website locally using hot reloading: `npm run dev`.
5. Does the new person entry look good? Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch. The website will automatically update.
