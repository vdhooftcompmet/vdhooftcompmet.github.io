# Tutorials

This folder contains step-by-step guides for adding new content to the website.  
All content items are **Markdown-based** and will automatically render on the site after you commit and push your changes.

- [How to add a news message](add-news.md)
- [How to add a person](add-person.md)
- [How to add a blog](add-blog.md)

ðŸ‘‰ **Images**: 
All images used in content should be placed inside the `public/images/` folder in a subfolder that matches the content type (e.g. `images/news/`, `images/people/`, `images/blogs/`).  
Reference them in your markdown using relative paths.
