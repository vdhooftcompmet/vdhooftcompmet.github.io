At that point, I had just started looking into different natural product classes, and I remember having trouble wrapping my head around the various classifications and what they entailed. Reading up on the origins, these classifications were vague in definition; part of the classifications are derived from extraction methods, others from properties or substructures the compounds contained, yet others from purely historical conventions. Not satisfied with these inconclusive classifications, my first \u2013 perhaps overambitious \u2013 curiosity became the quest to new, more airtight classifications.

Whatever it was, this book led to a tipping point in Biosynfoni\u2019s creation: it had successfully introduced a systematic collection of Natural Product building blocks, including metabolic pathway annotations and interrelatedness for each of them. It described 8 main substructures originating from 4 pathways, and provided a nice schematic view of their biosynthesis and how it was linked to the glycolysis pathway. Thus, by seeing what substructure a molecule contains, you could derive what biosynthetic pathway(s) it originates from, providing a robust classification tactic."}),(0,s.jsx)("br",{}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{children:(0,s.jsx)("strong",{children:"The ideology"})}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{children:"This set of building blocks allowed easy creation of a substructure-key fingerprint: just define the substructure keys to be these building blocks.

A human eye would detect how many units of one substructure are present in the molecule (counted), and would also detect these substructures even if there are some small modifications to it (fuzzy). In general, it would see the most \u2018important\u2019 or obvious substructure, even if that substructure in itself contains smaller substructures: these are \u2018hierarchically less important\u2019, and a human would just choose to ignore the smaller substructures within the larger one.

These two tasks \u2013 biosynthetic similarity prediction and classification \u2013 would test Biosynfoni\u2019s performance. For these tasks, my personal goal was to achieve these as straight-forwardly as possible, ideally without machine learning methods. Accordingly, my initial ideal classification algorithm was: 1) count the number of detected substructures belonging to each of the 4 annotated pathways, 2) the count proportion of a pathway is the \u2018class-likeness score\u2019 for that pathway-class. While this was an interesting approach, the largest problem is that there is no way of assessing Biosynfoni performance compared to other fingerprints, or even to other classification tools.

Ultimately, we even added building blocks without a pathway, as well as various decoration substructures to increase the fingerprint coverage (sensitivity) of molecules! However, while we did tweak my \u2018Biosynformatic manifesto\u2019 \u2013 as I had nicknamed the foundational ideas of Biosynfoni \u2013 here and there, enough foundations remained to give Biosynfoni its characteristic properties.
