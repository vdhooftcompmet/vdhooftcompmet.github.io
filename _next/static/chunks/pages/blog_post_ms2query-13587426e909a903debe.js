This implementation still required the user to compare multiple scores and sources of metadata to decide which of the predicted library matches by MS2Query was the best. To simplify the process for the end-user, the idea of combining the mass spectral similarity scores and metadata into one metascore was born."}),(0,s.jsx)("br",{}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{children:"After Joris' internship ended, Niek de Jonge took over the project. It was clear that this project would be more extensive than initially anticipated. Thus, the code was refactored to ensure its maintainability while taking lessons learned from the first prototype. In the prototype, the user could select the most likely candidate based on how the library molecules were related in a small molecular network. This gave Niek the idea that it might be possible to automate the reranking based on the small molecular network. This would make MS2Query a lot more user-friendly since no time-intensive reranking had to be done by the user. Using multiple closely related library molecules for reranking was automated in MS2Query, which in the end resulted in a big improvement in the performance of MS2Query compared to using MS2Deepscore alone.
