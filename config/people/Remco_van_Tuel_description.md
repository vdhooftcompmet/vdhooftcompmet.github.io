Remco is working with <strong><Link href="../people/Justin_van_der_Hooft">Justin</Link></strong> and <strong><Link href="../people/Niek_de_Jonge">Niek</Link></strong> on assessing the quality of mass spectral embeddings for metabolite annotation. These embeddings are trained on instrument type-specific mass spectra and will be compared to general models (including all types of instruments) that the group worked with so far.
