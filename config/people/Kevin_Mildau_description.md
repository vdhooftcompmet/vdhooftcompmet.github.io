Kevin holds a BSc. in Biotechnology (Systems and Synthetic Biology) and a MSc. in Bioinformatics, both from Wageningen University & Research (WUR). After his MSc he continued with a research project on microbiome community statistics at the Mathematical and Statistical Methods group (WUR) and Danone Nutricia Research. His education and research activities focused heavily on Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis in the Life Sciences. In his current project he is working on improving untargeted metabolomics analysis workflows through i) evaluating and developing methodology for structural annotation of untargeted metabolomics data acquired using LC-MS/MS instruments, and ii) through developing statistical approaching for pinpointing spectra of interest more effectively.<br/><br/>

Kevin is PhD candidate at the Biochemical Network Analysis group of Prof. Jürgen Zanghellini, part of the Institute of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna. His project is done in close collaboration with and co-supervised by Assist. Prof. Justin van der Hooft.<br/><br/>
