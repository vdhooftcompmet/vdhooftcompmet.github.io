Dr. Fidele Tugizimana and his research group, in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, applies metabolomics approaches in interrogating cellular biochemistry at global level, specifically in plant-environment interactions, in the natural products research and biostimulant research. We have also made contributions in development of methodologies in metabolomics data acquisition and analysis and in mass-spectrometry-based metabolite identification. The research group is involved in driving the implementation of tools and workflows developed and used in extracting information from metabolomics data, exploring 4IR technologies in metabolomics, the use of machine learning and integrated novel computational frameworks (e.g., GNPS ecosystem and computational tools) in mining and interpreting metabolomics spectral data.<br/><br/>
