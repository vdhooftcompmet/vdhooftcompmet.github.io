We are very excited to announce the publication of a new preprint by <strong><Link href="../people/Joris_Louwen">Joris</Link></strong>, <strong><Link href="../collabs/Marnix_Medema">Marnix</Link></strong>, and <strong><Link href="../people/Justin_van_der_Hooft">Justin</Link></strong> on enhanced correlation-based linking of biosynthetic gene clusters to their metabolic products through chemical class matching. You can read more about their work <strong><Link href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1391827/new/v1">here</Link></strong> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faExternalLinkAlt} size="xs"/>.<br/><br/>
