We are proud to announce the work of Wout Bittremiux et al. on creating a nearest neighbort suspect spectral library that can help with interpreting unannotated spectra. <strong><Link href="../people/Justin_van_der_Hooft">Justin</Link></strong> collaborated on this exciting project in which they showed how they could use this newly created library to better understand an Alzheimer's brain phenotype. The preprint is available <strong><Link href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.15.490691v1">here</Link></strong> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faExternalLinkAlt} size="xs"/>.<br/><br/>
