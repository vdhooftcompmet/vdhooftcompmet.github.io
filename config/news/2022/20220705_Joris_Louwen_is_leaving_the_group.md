We are sad to announce that <strong><Link href="../people/Joris_Louwen">Joris</Link></strong> is leaving the Van der Hooft Computational Metabolomics Group. Joris was very much appreciated because of his attention to detail, great work ethic, and all-round energizing presence in the office. We wish you all the best on your next adventure! You will certainly be missed!
