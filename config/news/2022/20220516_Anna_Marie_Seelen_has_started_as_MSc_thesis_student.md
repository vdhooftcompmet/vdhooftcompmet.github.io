Today, <strong><Link href="../people/Anna_Marie_Seelen">Anna-Marie Seelen</Link></strong> started her MSc Thesis project with our group, she is introducing herself:<br/><br/>

Hi everyone, My name is Anna-Marie and I started my MSc thesis at the Bioinformatics group today (16th of May)! During my thesis I will be supervised by Justin and Niek. The thesis project will be about the annotation and identification of metabolites in urine using LC-MS/MS data. I previously completed a master's in Food Technology, and this knowledge will probably come in useful during this thesis. I am looking forward to the collaboration with everyone at Bioinformatics and learning a lot during my thesis here!<br/><br/>

Please join us in giving her a warm welcome!<br/><br/>
