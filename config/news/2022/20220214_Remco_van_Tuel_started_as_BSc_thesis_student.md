Please join us in welcoming <strong><Link href="../people/Remco_van_Tuel">Remco van Tuel</Link></strong>, who joined our group this week to do his BSc Thesis. Remco will be working with <strong><Link href="../people/Justin_van_der_Hooft">Justin</Link></strong> and <strong><Link href="../people/Niek_de_Jonge">Niek</Link></strong> on assessing the quality of mass spectral embeddings for metabolite annotation when trained on instrument type-specific mass spectra as compared to the general models (including all types of instruments) that we worked with so far.
Letâ€™s help Remco where we can and wish him good luck with his BSc Thesis!<br/><br/>
