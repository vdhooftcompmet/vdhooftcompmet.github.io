In this work, <strong><Link href="../people/Kevin_Mildau">Kevin</Link></strong> and colleagues developed homologueDiscoverer, an R package that can be used to detect potential homologue series using a heuristics-based recursive search algorithm. Such homologue series can either be from wanted relevant molecules or unwanted ones (i.e., contaminants, background) - with the latter a peak list from an untargeted metabolomics experiment can be cleaned up prior to subsequent (statistical) analyses. Great collaboration between Wageningen University and the University of Vienna!<br/><br/>
