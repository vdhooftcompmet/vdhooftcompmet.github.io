We are proud of PhD candidate Lerato Nephali from the <strong><Link href="../collabs/Fidele_Tugizimana">Fidele group</Link></strong>  who applied many computational metabolomics tools to zoom in on the chemical repertoire of biostimulant Bacillus strains. She studied both isolates and a consortium and observed differences in their chemical profiles. Recent tools like molecular networking and MS2LDA substructure discovery facilitated the annotation of the bacterial chemical space. A better understanding of the chemical language of bacteria will bring us one step closer to understanding their interaction with plants.
