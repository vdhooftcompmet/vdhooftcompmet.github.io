In particular, he focused on mass spectrometry fragmentation approaches to gather more structural information on measured molecules. In 2012 Justin obtained his PhD and he then moved to Glasgow where he worked on several postdoc projects including epicatechin bioavailability, drug screening, and bacterial metabolomics.<br/><br/>It was also in Glasgow where he set up a collaboration with Dr Simon Rogers and Dr Joe Wandy, and the concept of MS2LDA to discover substructures in tandem mass spectrometry data was borne. In September 2017 Justin moved back to Wageningen to start on a joint postdoc between Prof. Pieter Dorrestein’s group at UCSD and Dr Marnix Medema’s group at WUR with the focus on combining genome and metabolome mining. In May 2018, he started on a 3-year grant from the Netherlands eScience Center that further expands the work on metabolome mining with the aim to accelerate deciphering of complex metabolic mixtures as well as the combination with genome mining for structural annotation of natural products.<br/><br/>In 2020, Justin started his own group as assistant professor in computational metabolomics in Wageningen. His research vision is to close the gap between what we can see in metabolomics and what we can actually learn from it. This will enable biochemical interpretation of spectral data obtained from complex metabolite mixtures through structural and functional annotations. This will depend on finding out: i) which structural information is encoded in metabolomics data; ii) how novel chemistry can be recognised in spectral data, and iii) how to effectively identify relevant metabolite groups in metabolomics profiles of complex metabolite mixtures? He will develop computational metabolomics approaches inspired by two other fields - that of natural language processing (NLP) and genomics. For example, he has pioneered the use of topic modeling and word embedding NLP algorithms to discover substructures and structural relationships in metabolomics profiles. He will use the plant root microbiome and human food metabolome as prime applications since they represent complex metabolite mixtures full of yet unknown metabolic matter that once elucidated will boost our insights in molecular mechanisms underpinning the regulation of growth, development, and health.<br/><br/>You can find Justin’s publications <strong><a href="https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=zv9seLwAAAAJ">here</a></strong> <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16 fa-xs " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg><br/><br/><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="/_next/static/image/config/imgs/Resource_Metabolomics_EN_small.70f9a25d477324eb8199ecfbbd5ee58c.png" alt="Resource_Metabolomics_EN_small"/><small>Figure made by <strong><a href="https://www.stijnschreven.nl">Stijn Schreven</a></strong></small> <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16 fa-xs " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></div><br/><br/><div class="mb-4"><h5>Ancillary activities</h5></div>Member of Advisory Board NAICONS Srl, Milano, Italy<br/><br/></a><br/></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="content-border-footer"></div><div class="container text-muted text-center pt-2 px-5"><small>© 2022  <a href="https://github.com/vdhooftcompmet/">Van der Hooft Computational Metabolomics Group</a></small></div><div class="container text-muted text-center px-5"><small>Embedded in the  <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Bioinformatics.htm">Bioinformatics Group</a>  of the Plant Sciences Group at WUR</small> <img class="wur_footer_logo" src="/_next/static/image/config/logo/wur_logo_small.d8950f348b1906c131ed6f1342d0a11b.png" alt="wur_logo_small"/></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/people/Justin_van_der_Hooft","query":{},"buildId":"0PL7VSMXsM03mXTQgSY1a","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
