Congratulations to Joris and the entire NPOmix team for this collaborative effort! The [paper](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac257/6847575) describes a k-nearest neighbor classifier to systematically connect mass spectrometry fragmentation spectra to their corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters using paired omics datasets from the Paired Omics Data Platform to train and thest the performance.
