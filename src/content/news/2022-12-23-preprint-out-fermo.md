Congratulations to Mitja for his work on FERMO, a dashboard app for LC-MS/MS data analysis and analyzation. With FERMO you can quickly prioritize molecular features putatively responsible for biological observations.

Check out the GitLab page to start using FERMO locally, or read the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.21.521422v1).
