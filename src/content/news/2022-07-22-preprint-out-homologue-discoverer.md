In this work, Kevin and colleagues developed homologueDiscoverer, an R package that can be used to detect potential homologue series using a heuristics-based recursive search algorithm. Such homologue series can either be from wanted relevant molecules or unwanted ones (i.e., contaminants, background) - with the latter a peak list from an untargeted metabolomics experiment can be cleaned up prior to subsequent (statistical) analyses. Great collaboration between Wageningen University and the University of Vienna!
