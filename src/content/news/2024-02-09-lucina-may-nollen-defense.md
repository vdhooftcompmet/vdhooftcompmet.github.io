We are proud of Lucina who successfully defended her MSc thesis last Friday! Lucina has been working on the development of a natural product fingerprint that focusses on the biosynthetic building block make-up of the natural products. Lucina showed how this fingerprint can be used to predict biosynthetic pathway prediction and biosynthetic distance estimation. Congratulations Lucina! We are looking forward to seeing your work published soon!
