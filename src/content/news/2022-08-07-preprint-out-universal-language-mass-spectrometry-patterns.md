Great collaborative effort led by Mingxun Wang, Alan K. Jarmusch, Pieter Dorrestein, and many others on MassQL. MassQL allows you to define and share mass spectrometry patterns in MS and tandem MS data to find and select specific spectra of particular molecules.

Justin helped to test the software tool and also contributed a use case about acylcarnitine urine screening. He used MassQL to refine ms2lda substructure discovery patterns.
