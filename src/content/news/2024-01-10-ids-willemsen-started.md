We would like to extend a warm welcome to Ids Willemsen. Ids will work on the computational metabolomics analysis of a plant-microbiome dataset, together with Rumyana Karlova from Plant Physiology at Wageningen University and Justin van der Hooft.

We are excited to have Ids on board and look forward to his contributions to our team!
