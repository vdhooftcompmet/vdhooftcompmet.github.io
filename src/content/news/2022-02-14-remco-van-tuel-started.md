Please join us in welcoming Remco van Tuel, who joined our group this week to do his BSc Thesis. Remco will be working with Justin and Niek on assessing the quality of mass spectral embeddings for metabolite annotation when trained on instrument type-specific mass spectra as compared to the general models (including all types of instruments) that we worked with so far. Letâ€™s help Remco where we can and wish him good luck with his BSc Thesis!
