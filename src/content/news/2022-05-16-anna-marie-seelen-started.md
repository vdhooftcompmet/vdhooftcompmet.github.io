Today, Anna-Marie Seelen started her MSc Thesis project with our group, she is introducing herself:

Hi everyone, My name is Anna-Marie and I started my MSc thesis at the Bioinformatics group today (16th of May)! During my thesis I will be supervised by Justin and Niek. The thesis project will be about the annotation and identification of metabolites in urine using LC-MS/MS data. I previously completed a master's in Food Technology, and this knowledge will probably come in useful during this thesis. I am looking forward to the collaboration with everyone at Bioinformatics and learning a lot during my thesis here!

Please join us in giving her a warm welcome!
