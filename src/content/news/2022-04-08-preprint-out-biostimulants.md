We are proud of PhD candidate Lerato Nephali from the Fidele group who applied many computational metabolomics tools to zoom in on the chemical repertoire of biostimulant Bacillus strains. She studied both isolates and a consortium and observed differences in their chemical profiles. Recent tools like molecular networking and MS2LDA substructure discovery facilitated the annotation of the bacterial chemical space. A better understanding of the chemical language of bacteria will bring us one step closer to understanding their interaction with plants. The preprint is available [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1498018).
