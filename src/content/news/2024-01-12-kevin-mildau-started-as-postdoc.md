Please join us in welcoming Kevin Mildau as a postdoctoral researcher in our group! You might recognise Kevin as he was also part of our group as part of his PhD secondment.

During the first half a year of 2024, Kevin will continue his research development efforts by improving the accessibility of specXplore and msFeaST (in development) to the research community and extending their respective functionalities. Both tools allow researchers to explore LC-MS/MS datasets with help of mass spectral grouping, whereas msFeaST adds statistical information as an additional information layer.

Letâ€™s give Kevin a warm welcome during these winter days!
