We have created CineMol, a Python-based tool for small molecule visualization in cheminformatics. CineMol generates SVGs for 3D models without complexity, enabling easy customization and enhancing the visual appeal of scientific presentations. Start integrating CineMol into your Python workflow by installing CineMol from CineMol's[ GitHub GitHub page](https://github.com/moltools/CineMol).
