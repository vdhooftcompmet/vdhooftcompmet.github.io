We are proud to announce the work of Wout Bittremiux et al. on creating a nearest neighbort suspect spectral library that can help with interpreting unannotated spectra. Justin collaborated on this exciting project in which they showed how they could use this newly created library to better understand an Alzheimer's brain phenotype. The preprint is available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.15.490691v1).
