Annette Lien started her PhD project in our group today. She will be working with Justin van der Hooft and Marnix Medema on analysis of sub-clusters within (modular parts of) biosynthetic gene clusters, and connecting those to metabolite substructures and their associated metabolome peak patterns. This work is part of the MAGic-MolFun Marie-Curie EU doctoral network. Please give Annette a warm welcome!
