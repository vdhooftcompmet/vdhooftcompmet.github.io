Unlocking the secrets of microorganisms, scientists have discovered a promising class of natural products known as RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides). These metabolites, often overlooked, hold a potent biological activity that could revolutionize drug development, yet an estimated staggering 97% of natural product biosynthetic pathways remain unexplored. Read more about metabolome-guided genome mining of RiPPs in Mitja Zdouc's recently published review [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614723001311?dgcid=coauthor).
