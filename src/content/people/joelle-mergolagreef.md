Joelle completed her BSc in Chemistry from the University of Aberdeen (Scotland) in 2021 and continued at the same institution to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. Her doctoral research focused on computational chemistry, with a focus on understanding the behaviour of RiPPs as novel biomaterials with semiconductive properties, covering various classes such as cyanobactins and LAPs.

During her PhD, she collaborated closely with the company GyreOx, contributing to the development of automated methods for analysis and validation of synthetic cyclic peptides using LC-MS/MS fragmentation data. Her training also included industry-focused courses supported by IBioIC, ranging from patent protection to bioprocess cost evaluation and analysis.
In 2025, she joined the Microbial Natural Products group at Leiden University and the Computational Metabolomics group at Wageningen University & Research as a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Dr. Somayah Elsayed and Dr. Justin van der Hooft. Her current work aims to advance automated LC-MS-based analysis of RiPPs to resolve peptide sequences, characterise modifications and streamline class assignment.

Her research interests are RiPPs analysis and development, software engineering, and analytical chemistry.
