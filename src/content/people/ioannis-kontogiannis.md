Ioannis Kontogiannis holds a BSc in Biochemistry and Biotechnology from the University of Thessaly in Greece. During his undergraduate studies, he developed a strong interest in metabolomics, which became the central focus of his thesis titled “Characterization of Cyanobacteria Metabolites from Mass Spectrometry Data (LC-HRMS) Using the GNPS Platform.”
Motivated by the potential of computational analysis, he pursued an MSc in Bioinformatics at Wageningen University & Research in 2024. In 2025, Ioannis started his thesis under the supervision of Dr. Justin van der Hooft and PhD candidate Rosina Torres Ortega. His research involves the use of MS2LDA to explore how machine learning can enhance the interpretation of mass spectrometry data and uncover meaningful chemical patterns in natural products.

Outside of academia, Ioannis enjoys sports and going on adventures with friends.
