Annette holds a BSc. in Biotechnology from the Technical University of Braunschweig in Germany and a MSc. in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). During her master’s studies she worked as a research assistant under the guidance of Dr. Xinglin Jiang in the ‘Natural Products Genome Mining’ group at DTU Biosustain, where she developed a software tool for finding novel biosynthetic gene clusters through large-scale genome comparisons.

Continuing on this path, Annette started her PhD in August 2023 at Wageningen University and Research (WUR) under the supervision of Prof. Marnix Medema and Assistant Prof. Justin van der Hooft. Her research focuses on building new tools for analyzing shared building blocks in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and connecting them to metabolite substructures and their associated metabolome peak patterns.
