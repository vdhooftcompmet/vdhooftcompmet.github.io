After completing her Bachelor studies in Human Biology at the University of Greifswald, Germany, Sarah decided to continue with a Master in Bioinformatics at Wageningen University to focus more on the analysis of biological data and especially gaining knowledge in software engineering. Accordingly, her thesis entails the further development of FERMO, a tool to visualize and analyze LC-MS/MS data especially in the context of natural product research. The goal is to make an online version of FERMO and speed up some of its analysis. During this project she will be supervised by Mitja Zdouc, the main developer of FERMO, as well as Justin van der Hooft and Marnix Medema.
