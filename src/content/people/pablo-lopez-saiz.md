Pablo chose to study his MSc in Bioinformatics at Wageningen University following the completion of his BSc in Biotechnology at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. His academic journey was complemented by an Erasmus internship at Warsaw University of Life Sciences in Poland, where he awakened his interest to pursue studies in bioinformatics. Interested in Organic Chemistry and Programming, specifically in the realm of biological molecule prediction, he decided to start his thesis focused on the generative design of specialized metabolites.
