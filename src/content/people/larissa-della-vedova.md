Larissa obtained her MSc in Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Technology at the University of Milan (Italy) in 2021. She then pursued and completed a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the same institution, specializing in analytical chemistry with a focus on developing LC-(HR)MS analytical platforms for the precise identification and quantification of bioactive compounds. Her research covered a range of natural matrices, including grapes and bergamot, as well as biological samples such as urine, plasma, liver, and brain.

During her PhD, she investigated the pre-ADMET properties of isolated bioactive compounds, assessed their pharmacological potential through high-throughput in vitro models, and conducted in vivo DMPK studies to evaluate the impact of formulations on the distribution, metabolism, and excretion of APIs. Her doctoral training also included an international collaboration as a visiting scholar at the NCNPR, University of Mississippi, where she further honed her expertise in natural product research.

In 2025, Larissa joined the Cell Biology, Metabolism & Cancer group at Utrecht University and the Computational Metabolomics group at Wageningen University & Research as a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Celia Berkers and Dr. Justin van der Hooft. Her work focuses on the development of (un)targeted metabolomics pipelines using LC-MS to explore the metabolome in recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) and investigate metabolite signatures linked to resilience, invasion, or pathogenicity.

Larissaâ€™s main research interests include metabolomics, bioanalytical chemistry, and microbiome-host interactions. Outside of the lab, she enjoys snorkeling, trying different types of cuisine, and has a fondness for 90s TV shows, classical novels, and a good cup of coffee.
