Elena is a second-year PhD candidate in the HIP-TECH program at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy. She holds a MSc in Pharmacy and her research focuses on targeted and untargeted metabolomics using HPLC–HRMS in pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis. 

A major part of her work applies mass spectrometry–based metabolomics to forensic toxicology, particularly to the detection of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS). These compounds are often small structural modifications of known drugs and can escape traditional targeted screening strategies, making their identification a challenging analytical and computational problem.

At WUR, Elena aims to build upon a high-dimensional LC–HRMS/MS metabolomics dataset of human biofluids — including reference standards, spiked samples, and real-case samples containing drugs of abuse and related metabolites — to develop a computational metabolomics pipeline that integrates machine learning–based approaches. The objective is not only to apply existing annotation tools, but also to train data-driven models capable of learning structural and spectral patterns directly from MS/MS data and generalizing to previously unseen compounds.
Ultimately, her goal is to move toward a more flexible and adaptive system for detecting and classifying emerging drugs of abuse.
