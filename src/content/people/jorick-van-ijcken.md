Jorick holds a BSc in Molecular Life Sciences from Wageningen University & Research (WUR). During his MSc in Molecular Life Sciences, he developed a strong interest in bioinformatics, where he can combine his scientific background with a passion for solving practical problems through creativity and abstract thinking. 

Jorick will conduct his MSc thesis in the Van der Hooft Group at the Department of Bioinformatics, under supervision of Assistant Professor Dr. Justin van der Hooft and Postdoctoral Researcher Dr. Esteban Charria Girón. He will work on contextualized spectral pattern annotation using computational metabolomics network-based approaches, such as MS2LDA and SNAP-MS. Through this work, he aims to increase coverage and confidence of tandem MS data annotations.
