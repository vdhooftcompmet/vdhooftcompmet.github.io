Koen is working on the in silico analysis and selection of secondary metabolites in LC-MS data according to genomic information. The aim is to expand FERMO with a module that automatically predicts BGC, metabolites and their corresponding spectra, therefore increasing the accuracy of the analysis. Mitja and Justin will be supervising him during this thesis.
