Selina was working with Iris Kappers (Laboratory of Plant Physiology, WUR) and Justin van der Hooft, investigating on the changes of specialised metabolites in tomato leaves grown under different light spectra and mimicked herbivory attack. An untargeted metabolomic approach was used with liquid chromatography (tandem) mass spectrometry and GNPS as the analytical method.
