During his master Molecular life sciences at Wageningen University, Niek decided to focus on Bioinformatics. During his internship at the eScience Center he worked on machine learning algorithms for analyzing mass spectrum data. Since September 2021, Niek continues on this path by doing a PhD in computational Metabolomics, where he focuses on building novel algorithms for the structural annotation of mass spectrometry data.
