Kumar Saurabh Singh is a postdoctoral researcher working together with Prof. dr. Marnix Medema at Wageningen University and Prof. dr. Saskia Van Wees at the Plant-Microbe Interaction group of Utrecht University, The Netherlands. He received his MSc in Bioinformatics from Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK in 2007.

In 2014, after obtaining a PhD degree from the University of Camerino, Italy, in applied bioinformatics, he joined the group of Prof. Chris Bass, first at Rothamsted Research, UK, and then at the University of Exeter, UK, where he led projects involving sequencing of multiple arthropod genomes to investigate resistance development and evolution in insect pests against plant-based and synthetic insecticides. During this time, he explored latest sequencing technologies, generated multi-omics datasets, and investigated those datasets using population genomics, phylogenomic and comparative genomics-based methods.

In May 2021, he started a postdoc position at the Wageningen University, where he is exploring and implementing innovative omics integration strategies to map genes and their expression patterns to metabolites (combining knowledge from genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics) that play key roles in host-microbe interactions. His specific research interests revolved around investigating and understanding patterns and mechanisms of plant biotic interactions and co-evolution.
