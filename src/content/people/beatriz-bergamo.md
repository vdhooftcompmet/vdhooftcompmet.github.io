Beatriz is an undergraduate student of Biochemical Pharmacy at Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto (FCFRP), Universidade de São Paulo (USP). She has been an active member of the Computational Chemical Biology Laboratory since 2020. In 2021, she finished a metagenomics project that was a partnership between USP and Natura. In this project, she set up a pipeline of bacterial sequence data analysis to build a map of the metabolic functions performed by these. Currently she is working with Daniela in a Collaborative Benchmarking with tools that uses spectral libraries. The goal is to understand in which cases the tools perform better by giving results we can trust more.
