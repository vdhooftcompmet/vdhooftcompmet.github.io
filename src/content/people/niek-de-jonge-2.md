During his master’s in Molecular Life Sciences at Wageningen University, Niek developed a strong interest in Bioinformatics. During his internship at the eScience Center, he worked on machine learning algorithms for analyzing mass spectrometry data. After completing his master’s, he continued in this field by pursuing a PhD in Computational Metabolomics. His research focuses on developing software and machine learning models to support the interpretation of mass spectrometry data, particularly for spectra lacking full annotation. He has contributed to the development of several tools, including MS2Query, matchms, MS2DeepScore, and MassSpecGym. Since November 2025, Niek has been working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Metabolomics group, where he focuses on improving the accessibility of these tools for the research community and developing new versions with enhanced functionality.
