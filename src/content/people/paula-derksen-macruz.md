Paula is a PhD student at the State University of Maringá (UEM), Brazil. She holds bachelor’s degrees in Environmental Engineering and Chemistry. Her experience lies in the optimization and development of LC-MS/MS methods for the chemical profiling of diverse matrices, as well as in designing metabolomic pipelines.

Her current research is conducted in collaboration with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) and focuses on the metabolomics of rotten soybean seeds and stem breakage. The main goals of her work are to apply bioinformatics tools to expand compound annotation in these samples, enabling the identification of the actual pathogens responsible for the observed symptoms and ultimately contributing to minimizing the economic losses caused by such diseases.

Outside of the lab, she enjoys swimming, hiking, and spending time in nature. She is also passionate about trying foods from around the world and appreciates a good cup of coffee.
