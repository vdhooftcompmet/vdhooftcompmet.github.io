Luka will be working with Justin and the group of Aalt-Jan van Dijk on a project aiming to improve metabolite annotation strategies through mass spectral embeddings and structure embeddings. My focus will be on exploring and optimising DeepCCA â€” a Deep learning algorithm based on Canonical Correlation. We hope to use this algorithm to predict metabolite structures based on MS/MS spectra.
