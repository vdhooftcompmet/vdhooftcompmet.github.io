Mahdere obtained her MSc and PhD in plant sciences from Wageningen University. In 2019, she joined the department of microbial ecology at NIOO-KNAW as a postdoctoral researcher. Working under supervision of Prof. Jos Raaijmakers, she dedicated her efforts to discovering a microbial solution for addressing the issue of Striga harmonica in sorghum. Starting from January 2023, she embarked on her second postdoctoral researcher position at the bioinformatics group of Wageningen University. In this role, she is jointly supervised by Dr. Justin van der Hooft and Dr. Marnix Medema. Her primary focus is to integrate multi-omics data to gain a deeper understanding of the role played by bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters during Striga infection and their correlation with metabolome changes in the rhizosphere.
