Jonas holds a BSc and an MSc in Chemistry, with a specialization in Cheminformatics, both from Friedrich-Schiller-University (FSU) in Jena. During his Master's program, Jonas spent a year at Gothenburg University, where he worked on developing novel machine learning (ML) scoring functions for the drug development process. Back in Jena he conducted his Master's Thesis in the Steinbeck group for Cheminformatics and Computational Metabolomics under the guidance of Dr. Peter Bellstedt (ZÃ¼rich University), focusing on applying ML to predict secondary structure contents of proteins based on NMR-Spectroscopy using N-HSQC spectra.

Starting in mid-October 2023, Jonas commenced a joint PhD program between the Wageningen University Bioinformatics group and the Wageningen Food Safety Research Center (WFSR), under the supervision of Justin van der Hooft and Hans Mol. During his PhD project, Jonas will be responsible for developing an automated computational workflow for assessing chemical risks related to food safety.

Jonas' primary research interests encompass cheminformatics, analytical chemistry, and metabolomics.
