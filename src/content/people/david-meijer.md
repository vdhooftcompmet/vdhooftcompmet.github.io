After obtaining his propadeutics in chemistry at the University of Amsterdam, David moved to Wageningen to further his studies in biotechnology at Wageningen University, with a minor in bioinformatics. Enamored by dry lab science, David continued pursuing a master's degree in bioinformatics at Wageningen University. During his studies, he specialized in applying deep learning techniques to natural product compounds and conducted a master's thesis project under the supervision of Dr Marnix Medema and Barbara Terlouw on the same topic. David obtained his master's degree with distinction in October 2021 after an enthusing final internship at Demetrix under the supervision of Dr. Darren Platt, where he engineered software for modeling bioreactors.

Since October 2021, David is a PhD candidate under the supervision of Dr. Marnix Medema and Dr. Justin van der Hooft in the Bioinformatics Group at Wageningen University, where he works on elucidating the relationship between biosynthetic gene clusters and secondary metabolism. David is interested in software engineering, graph neural networks, secondary metabolism, and retro and forward biosynthesis.
