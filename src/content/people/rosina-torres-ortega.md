Rosina holds a BSc. in Agrogenomic Sciences from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM). During her final year of bachelor's, she participated in the worldwide competition "Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge" at Wageningen University. There, she collaborated with Intel to develop an algorithm for remotely cultivating cucumbers.

Afterwards, she returned to Mexico to pursue her MSc. in Plant Biotechnology at the Centro de Estudios Avanzados del IPN (CINVESTAV). Her thesis focused on developing a system for measuring real-time organic volatile emission from a microalgae called Neochloris oleoabundans. She designed both the hardware and software for analyzing the changing dynamic pattern of volatiles produced by the microalgae under different stress conditions.

Rosina joined the group in October 2023 as one of the 11 PhD students participating in the MAGic MOLFUN project. Her research will involve enhancing MS annotations by subclustering molecules. Additionally, she will contribute to improving the NPLinker framework and developing new scores for linking bioactivity, metabolome, and genome data. Her main research interests lie in statistics, systems biology, omics, and metabolomics.
