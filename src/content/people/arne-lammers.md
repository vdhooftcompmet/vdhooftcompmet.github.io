Arne Lammers holds a BSc in Computer Science and is currently pursuing an MSc in Bioinformatics. His transition to bioinformatics was driven by a passion for applying algorithmic skills to better understand nature and its mysteries.

For his Master’s thesis with the BIF chair group, supervised by Justin and Andrea Mizzi Brunner (TNO), Arne is developing a machine learning workflow that predicts the oxidative potential of airborne particulate matter by analyzing complex chemical fingerprints from high-resolution MS data, aiming to better understand the toxicological risks of these often unknown organic compounds.

Outside of academia, Arne enjoys hiking, cycling, listening to music, and doing hobby coding projects.
