Dora Ferreira has a BSc in Medicinal Biotechnology from the Polytechnic of Porto and a MSc in Applied Microbiology from the Catholic University of Portugal. During her MSc thesis at CIIMAR (University of Porto), she worked on applying OSMaC strategies to uncover new natural products from marine cyanobacteria, with a focus on metallophores.

She is currently a PhD candidate at Naicons Srl (Milan, Italy) and the MAGic-MOLFUN Doctoral Network, under the main supervision of Dr. Margherita Sosio. Her work centers around combining metabolomics and genomics data for the discovery of novel compounds from Dactylosporangium - a rare actinomycetes genus. She did a 2-month secondment at Wageningen University and Research (WUR) under the supervision of Dr. Justin van der Hooft, where she used NPLinker to explore her dataset, revealing potential links between gene cluster families and metabolite features.
