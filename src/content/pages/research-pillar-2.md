## Chemically-informed comparative metabolomics to prioritize chemistry

In this pillar, we tackle the challenge of prioritizing the relevant chemistry in your metabolomics profiles. Typically, thousands of metabolite features are observed, but which ones are worth your time and expertise to further explore? With improved annotation tools, chemical information about metabolite features such as substructure and chemical compound class annotations can be linked to metabolite features. At the same time, developments such as Feature Based Molecular Networking, have brought together quantitative and qualitative metabolomics workflows. Quantitative workflows usually result in metabolite feature quantification tables that form the input for statistical analyses, taking into account the study design. These recent developments have triggered the development of tools such as QemisTree that can compare samples in an chemically-informed manner: by annotating large parts of the metabolome, samples can be compared considering their chemical contents, and novel chemistry can be more easily highlighted. We will further investigate how various statistical models for sample comparisons can be best used in tandem with metabolome mining tools.
